        "Search engines produce two types of clicks for businesses:\n",
        "* Organic clicks which occur when a user clicks on a normal search result (i.e. not a search ad)\n",
        "* Paid clicks which occur when a user clicks on an advertisement.\n",
        "\n",
        "One concern about search engine advertising is that paid clicks will \"cannibalize\" organic clicks. In other words, if a brand runs a search advertising campaign users might click on the search ad when they otherwise would have clicked on the organic search result.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose that a brand averages 500 organic clicks per month.  One month they decide to run a search advertising campaign and this results in 1000 clicks.  But the organic clicks for that month dropped to 400.  Assuming nothing else impacted organic clicks, the \"incremental\" clicks from the search advertising campaign would be 900 (1000 + 400 - 500). Or, put another way, search advertising cannibalized 100 organic clicks.  If the brand paid \\$2.50 CPC for 1,000 clicks, the \"cost per incremental click\" would the total cost, \\$2,500, divided by the number of incremental clicks, 900 = $2.78.\n",

        "A large national retailer is interested in understanding if search engine advertising will impact their organic clicks, and if so, how much.  To estimate this, the retailer chose one of their product categories and ran a search engine advertising campaign for six weeks in 50 designated market areas (DMAs).  DMAs represent metro area across the entire United States - you can read more about them at [Nielsen's website](https://www.nielsen.com/dma-regions/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The retailer has data for three other product categories that they did NOT run a search advertising campaign for.  The goal of this assignment is to estimate the impact of search advertising on organic clicks.\n"

        "Based on the graphs, I find **'Home Furniture Decor'** to be the best synthetic control for 'Beauty and Household Essentials'. The graph appears to be the best among the others because the observed data closely follows the predicted mean before the intervention, indicating a stable and predictable control. Post-intervention, the pointwise differences are smaller and less volatile compared to previous graphs, and the cumulative effect shows a more gradual trend, suggesting that the observed data remains close to the counterfactual prediction. This behavior implies that the synthetic control has captured the pre-intervention characteristics well, leading to a more reliable estimation of the intervention's impact. The stable confidence intervals before and after the intervention underscore the reliability of **'Home Furniture Decor'** as a synthetic control for **'Beauty and Household Essentials'**.\n",
